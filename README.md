# ⛏️ Picky

Picky lets you easily select files to build a prompt.

Claude Code is great, but sometimes you still want to chuck the whole thing into a chat window!

```
brew install eliooooooot/tap/picky
```

## TODO

- [ ] allow copying to clipboard without exiting
- [ ] file watch for changes so you can keep a `picky` session running and still get accurate token counts
- [ ] allow only selecting chunks from files, e.g. single functions
- [ ] handle terminal resizing properly
- [ ] make it pretty
- [ ] default to `./`
- [ ] persist selection state & prompt across sessions
